Project Description
---
When we go in to school, currently we submit our temperatures through temperature booklets. Our project will be to complete temperature checks through an app instead of paper. This way, we can focus on improving our environment and effectively use technology. Our goal is to make an app and design the app logo using graphic design. The app will allow the student to input their temperature before coming to school with a parent signature, and when the student's HKIS ID card is scanned, it will be able to show whether they have submitted their temperature.
